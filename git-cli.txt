git cmd line helper.  youtube tutorial: Git Tutorial for Beginners: Command-Line Fundamentals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4
1) basic commands:
git --version gives version/confirm git loaded in cli properly

ls -la to see files in current dir
	MS: ls is unix.  equiv for MS is dir

git init 	-places a project you are cd'd to under version control.  cd to dir you want to git and type this command.  
	use rm -rf .git - to remove from version control

git status 	-when cd'ed to git project this cmd lists git attributes

touch .gitignore to create a git ignore file for preference/local attr/bin/compile type files
	-MS: touch is unix.  MS equiv for dir is mkdir.  equiv for file is echo.> [filename]  --or-- type nul > [filename]

git add -A |[filename]	-adds/stages all untracked files into staged files, ready for commit.  A = all or by filename.
git reset [filename] 	-unstages file.  w/o filename it will unstage everything in dir
	
git commit -m "add a message about the change" 	-commits changes

git log 	-log of changes

git clone [url] [where to clone repo] - use . for dest if you already cd'ed to dir for files in project to be cloned.  creates a new copy into your specified dir.

git remote -v 	-get remote info.  switch is listing origin info.  See below if entirely new remote [github]
git branch -a 	-lists all branches
git branch 		-no switches will list the branch and the branch you are on will have asterisk.
git diff

2) Combined cli cmnds:
2.1) Commit
changed file code, ready to commit, sequence in cli:  add, commit -m "[add message]"
then if have remote: add, commit, pull origin master, push origin master  
	-are doing the pull first in shared codebase because others may have changed other pices of code in interim.  have to do that before your push.
	-branch- note that master above- 2nd switch is the branch name.  master is used here but normal flow of work is to a branch

2.2) New Branch, then merge post testing.  Establish new Branch for new code functionality.  Should not normally be working on master itself.
git branch [branch-name].  Overview of steps: branch create,checkout,add,commit,pull/push,tests done,checkout master, merge, delete branch
git checkout [branch-name]	-checks out new branch so you are working on that instead of master
	...make changes
git add -A
git commit -m "[detailed note about change]"
git push -u origin [branch-name] 		-establishes new branch in remote repo.  can remove -u switch on future pushes after branch is already created.
git branch -a
 **after tested and ready to merge to master
git checkout master
git merge [branch name]
git log
git branch -d [branch-name]				-to delete local branch
git push origin --delete [branch-name] 	-if pushed to remote- delete that to once all changes merged to master
git status

3) GitHub- establishing new remote for your local project
git remote add origin [url] 	-this creates a new repo cnx w/ locally and w/ a name of your choosing and establishes a remote origin on that repo.
	url format: https://github.com/user/repo.git
	ie: git remote add origin https://github.com/sgf14/VerControl.git
-instantiate repository in github.  Note the above only registers on local it doesnt instantiate it in github itself.  make sure you are using the same repo name.
git remote -v 	-to see new remote attr [but local assigned version only for the moment]
git push -u origin master	-this pushes local to github.  note you will have to login as part of this
git branch -a
