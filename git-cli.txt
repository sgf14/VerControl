git --version gives version/confirm git loaded in cli properly

ls -la to see files in current dir
	MS: ls is unix.  equiv for MS is dir

git init 	-places a project you are cd'd to under version control.  cd to dir you want to git and type this command.  
	use rm -rf .git - to remove from version control

git status 	-when cd'ed to git projec this cmd lists git attributes

touch .gitignore to create a git ignore file for preference/local attr/bin/compile type files
	-MS: touch is unix.  MS equiv for dir is mkdir.  equiv for file is echo.> [filename]  --or-- type nul > [filename]

git add -A |[filename]-adds all untracked files into staged files for commit.  all = all or by filename.  Stages file ready for commit
	git reset [filename] - removes file from version tracking
	
git commit -m "add a message about the change" -commits

git log 	-log of changes

git clone [url] [where to clone repo] - use . for dest if you already cd'ed to dir for files in project to be cloned.  creates a new copy into your specified dir.

git remote -v 	-get remote info.  switch is listing origin info
git branch -a 	-lists branches
git branch 		-no switches will list the branch and the branch you are on will have asterisk.
git diff

Combined cli cmnds:
changed file code, ready to commit, sequence in cli:  add, commit -m "[add message]"
then if have remote: add, commit, pull origin master, push origin master  
	-are doing the pull first in shared codebase because others may have changed other pices of code in interim.  have to do that before your push.

establish new Branch for new code functionality.  Should not normally be working on master itself.
git branch [name]
git checkout [name]
	...make changes
git add -A
git commit -m ""
git push -u origin [name] 	-establishes new branch in remote repo
git branch -a
